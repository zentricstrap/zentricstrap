Hi!
I'm salvador.
You can call me zentrics.
I own the TrapTrapMetal Exploitation Group.
No-one is accepted except high-experienced exploiters. You are not high-experienced if you "hack" roblox games with scripts.
High-experienced is the knowledge of scripting in lua, js, and being able to crack into sites with authentication backdoors.
